        the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I

        <blockquote class="light"> “ I was an EMT for
        many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
        here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
        I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
        grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
        startup. ” </blockquote>

        about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me
        the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
        myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
        You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
        community of smart and amazing people. ”</blockquote>

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly
        recommended!</blockquote> 
        
        <blockquote class="light"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
        code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
        of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
        and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
        particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
        way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
        certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
        multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</blockquote>
